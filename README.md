Passwords: Tips and Tricks

What are Passwords?

A password is a string of characters (letters, numbers, symbols) used to verify a user’s identity and grant access to a system, account, or device. It acts as a security barrier, ensuring that only authorized individuals can access protected resources like email, bank accounts, work systems, or personal data. Passwords can also be unique like fingerprints and facial scans. Passwords can be used in more ways then just online.

Passwords are the most common and widely adopted form of authentication—part of the broader concept known as "something you know" in cybersecurity's multi-factor authentication (MFA) model.

Purpose of a Password 

  Authenticate users to verify identity

  Protect sensitive information (e.g., personal data, company systems, finances)

  Control access to files, systems, devices, and networks

  Maintain confidentiality and integrity in digital communications and transactions

Types of Passwords

  Text-Based Passwords (Traditional)
   
    Common login method using alphanumeric combinations

    Examples: P@ssw0rd!, Tr33house2025

  Passphrases
    
    A longer sequence of random or meaningful words (often easier to remember but harder to crack)

    Example: PurpleGiraffe!Climbs4MountainsDaily

  One-Time Passwords (OTP)

    Temporary passwords that expire after one use or a short time

    Sent via SMS, email, or authentication apps

    Used as part of MFA or for password recovery

  Biometric-Backed Password Equivalents
   
    Not passwords in the traditional sense, but often paired with or replace them

    Examples: Face ID, fingerprint scans

  Time-Based One-Time Passwords (TOTP)
    
    A type of OTP generated by an app (like Google Authenticator)

    Refreshes every 30–60 seconds

    Used in secure 2FA systems

  PINs (Personal Identification Numbers)
    
    Typically 4–6 digit numbers used for devices or bank cards

    Easier to enter on mobile keypads but often less secure than full passwords

  System-Generated/Randomized Passwords

    Generated by password managers or security tools

    Often very strong but hard to memorize

    Example: X4v$93@Qlm!pZt#1

Cracking Passwords

Cybercriminals use a variety of methods—both technical and psychological—to crack passwords and gain unauthorized access to systems, data, and accounts.

Techniques For Breaking/Cracking Passwords

  1. Brute Force Attacks

    The attacker uses a program to try every possible combination of characters until the correct password is found.

    Time-consuming but effective against short or simple passwords.

    Example: Trying aaaa, aaab, aaac, etc., until the right one is discovered.

    Defense: Use long, complex passwords and account lockouts after failed attempts.

  
  2. Dictionary Attacks

    The attacker uses a list of common passwords or dictionary words.

    Much faster than brute force, especially if the user uses weak or common words.

    Example: Trying passwords like 123456, password, qwerty, or football.

    Defense: Avoid common words or phrases; use random combinations or passphrases.

  3. Credential Stuffing

    Hackers use usernames and passwords stolen from one data breach to try logging into other sites.

    Exploits the fact that many people reuse passwords across platforms.

    Defense: Never reuse passwords. Use a password manager to maintain unique ones.

  4. Phishing

    Hackers trick users into voluntarily revealing passwords, often through fake emails, websites, or texts that appear legitimate.

    Example: A fake login page that looks like your bank’s website.

    Defense: Always check URLs, verify senders, and enable MFA.

  5. Keylogging

    Malware secretly installed on a user’s device records keystrokes, capturing passwords as they are typed.

    Defense: Keep antivirus software updated and avoid downloading unknown software or files.

  6. Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks

    Hackers intercept communication between a user and a website to capture login credentials.

    Often happens on insecure Wi-Fi networks.

    Defense: Use HTTPS-secured websites and avoid public Wi-Fi unless protected with a VPN.

  7. Shoulder Surfing & Social Engineering

    Physically watching someone enter their password or tricking them into giving it away through conversation or impersonation.

    Defense: Be cautious when entering passwords in public and avoid sharing credentials.

  8. Offline Cracking of Password Hashes

    In system breaches, attackers may obtain hashed (encrypted) passwords.

    They use software to try combinations until they find a hash that matches—often using powerful computers or cloud services.

    Defense: Use systems that salt and hash passwords securely (BCrypt, Argon2), and rotate passwords regularly.

How to Create and Maintain a Strong Password

Creating a Password: 

  1. Use Long Passwords

    Aim for 12–16 characters or more.

    The longer the password, the harder it is to brute-force.

    Example: BlueTiger@Jumps!Over19Clouds

  2. Mix Character Types

    Combine:

      Uppercase letters (A–Z)

      Lowercase letters (a–z)

      Numbers (0–9)

      Symbols (!@#$%^&*)

      Example: G@laxy!Run44*SunRise

  3. Avoid Personal Information

  Do not use:

    Names

    Birthdays

    Favorite teams or pets

    Keyboard patterns (123456, qwerty, etc.)

  4. Use Passphrases

    Create a memorable phrase using random, unrelated words.

    Easier to remember, but hard to guess.

  Example: Correct-Horse_Battery!Staple92

  5. Don’t Reuse Passwords

    Each account should have its own unique password.

    Reusing passwords makes credential stuffing attacks far more dangerous.

Store Passwords Securely

  1. Use a Password Manager

    Safely stores and auto-fills complex passwords.

    Examples:

      Bitwarden (open source & secure)

      1Password

      LastPass

      Dashlane

      Personal Favorite - ProtonPass

    Benefits:

      Generates strong passwords

      Encrypts vaults locally

      Works across devices

      Makes it easy to maintain unique passwords for every site
